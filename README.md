 KSE_100_Prediction

The KSE 100 Index Prediction Model is a sophisticated data-driven solution designed to forecast the daily closing value of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) KSE 100 Index. Utilizing historical data spanning from May 22, 2009, to February 22, 2021, this project integrates advanced machine learning techniques to support investment decision.

**Key Features:**

**Data Processing:** Cleans and transforms raw data (Open, High, Low, Close, Change, Volume) into a usable format.\

**Feature Engineering:** Incorporates lagged Close values, moving averages, and daily returns to capture market trends.

**Hybrid Model:** Combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series analysis with XGBoost for feature-based predictions, achieving an RMSE of 421.69 on the test set.

**Visualizations:** Uses Seaborn to generate insights through plots like Actual vs. Predicted values and error distributions.

**Methodology:**

The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

LSTM models sequential patterns, while XGBoost leverages engineered features, with predictions averaged for optimal results.

Additional analyses, such as cross-validation and feature importance, enhance model reliability.

**Outcome:**

This project delivers a robust predictive tool, with visualizations and performance metrics to guide strategic investments. The code and documentation are available here , offering transparency and potential for further development.
